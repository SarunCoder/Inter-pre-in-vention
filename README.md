# Inter-pre-in-vention

##Concept

Writing and reading are collaborative and social behaviors. Language is a commons that is constituted by the community of language practitioners. We literally create language when we practice it together by reading, speaking, listening and writing. Technologies of language practice, be they oral, literary, or electrate in nature, form the vectors along which language enters the public sphere, giving it the potential to change and morph. As a product of the public, language is defined by accident, happenstance, and the various confluences of existing vectors, forces and states in human systems.

How can new systems of technological and cultural production change the ways we use language? When writing and reading are fully exposed and made available by the technical apparatus, what new patterns of meaning-making can emerge? As network and computational technologies become more powerful and available, how can their prosthetic, cybernetic functions change the way we write, read, and make inscription upon the commons of language?

In this project, tentatively titled Inter(pre|in)vention, we propose a performative, networked model for collaborative poetic production across both human and non-human invention. We plan to take advantage of the statistical errors of computational interpretation of human reading to generate new poetry, and as a result, new ways of meaning-making. These computational errors become metaphors for intuitive leaps. The computer's misinterpretation (and the resulting poems) will be displayed as part of an ever-changing network model. Using this network visualization, we can examine the collaborative process of language potential as it is actually happening. The network mediated platform becomes a visual and tangible, operational manifestation of the always collaborative, collective process of language making.

##Description

 Inter(pre|in)vention is a website that prompts the user to read a poem aloud. The website harnesses the user's microphone to listen to and interpret her speech into text. Much of the time the conversion will be successful, but often it will fail, and these failures become sites of invention. Each of these failures, or rather, re-interpretations, will be stored in textual form to be used as prompts for future readers. These users can then read the re-interpretations aloud to repeat the process so that the poems are in constant collaborative revision and production. As each poem begets new poems, a network graph grows from a single origin root, and this poetic network graph will be spatially explorable as a hypertext poem.

Each newly generated poem will be compared against its parent and sibling poems to find where it differs. These differences will drive the re-interpretation of the child poems by searching for the words on the Internet and/or our database of stored poems to find related words and texts. This feedback loop, contextually reseeding each new poem, will progress/regress each branch in radically different directions.
